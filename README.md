Click on the ‚ÄúDownload ZIP‚Äù, it will download a zip file to your downloads
Go to the downloads and ‚Äúunzip/uncompress‚Äù it. It will create a new folder with the same name.
Step 3: Open the Project Folder with the Cursor IDE:

Open the cursor, click on the ‚Äúfile‚Äù (left side, top corner)
Click on the ‚ÄúOpen Folder‚Äù, select our unzipped folder
Now, your project file is open in your Cursor IDE
Step 4: Create a Virtual Environment

Run the following command while inside the project directory:
python -m venv venv


Explanation: This command uses the venv module from Python's standard library to create a virtual environment named venv inside your current directory (project directory).
Step 5: Activate the Virtual Environment

On Ubuntu (or other Linux/macOS):
source venv/bin/activate


On Windows: Using Command Prompt (cmd.exe):
venv\Scripts\activate


Verification: After activation, your terminal prompt should change, typically showing (venv) at the beginning, like this:
(venv) yourusername@yourcomputer:~/mcplearningpath_generator$
    

Step 6: Install Requirements

Install the listed packages using pip. Run this command inside the activated virtual environment:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Step 7: Install Requirements

Run the app.py file from your terminal by using streamlit
streamlit run app.py


The application will be available at Local Host Streamlit by default.
